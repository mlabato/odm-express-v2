# Back-end service for e-commerce website "Outlet de Mates". 

## Introduction

Once i finished my Full Stack Developer studies at Digital House i was excited about giving my first steps as a web developer, so I contacted an instagram entepreneur, Nicolas. He didn't have money to pay me and i didn't have enough experience to develop an e-commerce project alone. So i proposed him to give small steps toward the full project without the pressure of having deadlines. This helped me to keep studying and learning new things.

## Overview

First of all, i had to get in touch with Nicolas' commercial needs, so the first step was to create an SQL database (the script can be found as odm-db.sql) to store all the product's and user's data (the script can be found as odmdata.sql).
I realised that the web needed two services: a back-end and a front-end, both hosted in different servers, communicated by an API. I chose to develop the back-end using express.js.

## Functionalities
The service offer:
- API for front-end service comsumption (all the products and users data that it needs).
- Database integration with Sequelize.
- Routing with Express.js.
